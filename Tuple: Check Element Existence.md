# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x = ('a', 'n', 'c', 3, 8, 5)
is_n_present = 'n' in x
is_8_present = 8 in x
print("'n' in tuple:", is_n_present)
print("8 in tuple:", is_8_present)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus  a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is successfully verified.
